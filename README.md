## What platform?

InventoryApp is created from scratch for Android.
For now :).

## What programming language?

 - App logic is written in Java language
 - App UI elements are organized in XML files

## What (human) languages?

App is fully translated into:

 - English
 - Polish
 > **Future:** it will be translated into **Norsk Bokmål** because **jeg elsker dette språket!**

## Why?

In the past I was learning C, later C++, then Java and I thought "I love Android and the mobile market so why do not create something for it?" and here I am ;).


## What in the future?

 - Rewritten in Kotlin,
 - Synchronization with Google,
 - As I mentioned before: **Norsk Bokmål** translation,
 - Calling to supplier,
 - Sound effects,
 - Totally new UI,
 - Maybe Flutter
